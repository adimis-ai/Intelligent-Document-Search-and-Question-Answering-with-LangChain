## Intelligent Document Search and Question Answering with LangChain

### Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating how to perform intelligent document search and question answering using the LangChain library and OpenAI's language models in a Google Colab environment. The project streamlines the process of extracting text from PDF documents, indexing them, and generating answers to user questions based on the document corpus.

### Prerequisites

- Python knowledge.
- Access to Google Colab.
- Familiarity with the LangChain library and the OpenAI API.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Open the provided Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab.

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to install the required dependencies and replace `<your key here>` with your OpenAI API key.

### Usage

1. Clone this repository and open the provided Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab.

2. Follow the installation instructions and replace `<your key here>` with your OpenAI API key.

3. Upload your PDF documents to a directory in your Google Drive.

4. Execute the cells in the notebook step by step to set up the environment, index the documents, and perform question answering.

5. Replace `<your question on the document corpus here>` with your specific question, and the notebook will provide answers based on the PDF documents you uploaded.

### Features

- Installation of necessary libraries, including LangChain, OpenAI, and PDF manipulation tools.
- Integration with Google Drive for accessing PDF documents.
- Extraction of text content from PDFs and creation of LangChain-compatible Document objects.
- Document indexing and retrieval with LangChain's FAISS vector store.
- Question answering using OpenAI language models.
- Efficient processing and splitting of large text documents.
- Chain-type setup for question answering with LangChain.
- A versatile pipeline for searching and answering questions on PDF documents.

### Acknowledgments

- This project leverages the LangChain library, OpenAI language models, and PDF manipulation tools to enable intelligent document search and question answering.
- Pretrained models and LangChain components are used to enhance the question answering process.
